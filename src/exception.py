    A class in Python is a blueprint for creating objects. It groups together data (attributes) and functions (methods) that operate on that data.
    
    The __init__ method is a special method in Python. It is called automatically when an object of the class is created.
    
    self is a reference to the current object of the class. and Itâ€™s used to access attributes and methods of the object.

    The __str__ method in Python is a special method that defines how an object is represented as a string.
