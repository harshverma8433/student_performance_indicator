CI/CD pipelines - refer to automated workflows used in software development to build, test, and deploy code changes efficiently and reliably. 
Steps in a CI/CD Pipeline:-
1 - Source Code Management:
    Developers push code to a version control system like Git (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket).
2 - Build:
    Compiles the code into an executable format or verifies dependencies (e.g., npm install, Maven build).
3 - Test:
    Executes unit tests, integration tests, and other quality assurance checks.
4 - Integration:
    Merges changes into a shared branch (e.g., main) after successful testing.
5 - Deployment:
    Automatically deploys the application to a staging or production environment.
6 - Monitoring:
    Tracks performance, errors, and other production issues
